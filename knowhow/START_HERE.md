## Top 5 Absolute Rules

- Never use username sero, always ironb
- Never use tools.sessions.visibility, key does not exist
- Never set Claude as fallback for Claude, both blocked on rate limit
- Never use gateway restart, use stop then start
- Never use sessions_send without session key

## Knowhow Vault

All accumulated knowhow lives in ARCHIVE/knowhow/.
See INDEX.md for full list. See individual files for details.
